# ocP5
This is the server for Project 5 of the Web Developer path.
It is modified from the the repository [here](https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P5-Web-Dev-Kanap)


### Server Installation ###
From the root folder of the project, run `npm install`. You 
can then run the server with `node server`. 
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
